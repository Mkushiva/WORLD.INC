So. . .
You're new at the work, huh?
Okay, let me tell it straight - it's not an easy job to do. 
Life of many people depend on your actions.
In fact, people of the whole planet. 
Your job is to keep the planet at peace. 
You'll have to solve its every problem. 
You will ask how would you do that.
That is very easy.
You just click on the button with a huge exclamation mark and then a minigame will open. 
That minigame is our company's algorithm that is supposed to solve the problem. 
You just have to complete the minigame and the algorithm will do the rest. 
But if you fail to do so . . .
Well . . .
You probably don't want to know.
Oh, I almost forgot. 
You need to change the internet, because either way you might get a malware 
that our company's competitors are still trying to disturb our work with. 
If you don't do it, your points will decrease and you will get fired. 
You have to keep an eye on the points. 
If they start to decrease, it means you might get fired and then, 
it's game over.
Either way, have fun.
Your shift starts at 10 pm and you have to make it till 4 am. 
Good luck.
