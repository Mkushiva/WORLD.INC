Subject: We have found you
Dear [Error],
Congratulations on your new job at World Incorported, Limited Liability Company! I hope you understand the gravity of the situation you've stepped into - this is not a dream job. 
Many have failed before you.
You should know that your every move is being closely watched. . .  
Do not think for a moment that you are safe from scrutiny. 
We have eyes everywhere, and we will know if you fail. 
Consider this your only warning: excel, or face the consequences.
We are watching, and we are not forgiving.
Sincerely,
A Very Concerned Competitor That Wants To Harm You :>
