Subject: Welcome (For Now)
Dear [You'll be fired either way],
Welcome to World.inc. 
I hope you're prepared for the reality of working here. I don't have the luxury of waiting for you to get up to speed, so I expect you to be productive from day one. 
The workload here is intense, and only those who are truly able to survive, can work here. 
If you can't keep up, don't worry - I have plenty of people who would love to take your place.
Expect long hours, overtime and a never-ending stream of tasks. 
You shouldn't believe in work-life balance here.
I believe in hard work, results and money (for the bosses, not you). 
Don't bother asking too many questions - you should be able to figure things out on your own. 
If you're constantly needing help, it's a sign that you might not be cut out for this.
If you fail to meet my expectations, you'll find yourself out.
I know there will be losses in your mental and psychical health and maybe your life, but we are prepared for that kind of loss. 
Good luck - you're going to need it. 
Best regards,
Boss of the bosses
