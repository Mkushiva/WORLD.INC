a game called WORLD.INC built with SFML, cpp

This game was a collaboration with another student - it is not polished, but we think about redoing it in Unity.


First of all, the game asks You to choose the resolution You want to use

It has a mail system, which we can first see during while playing the tutorial. The text is animated.

There are two main minigames - first is about dodging the viruses that collide with each other. The second one is a version of space invaders. You need to destroy all the viruses by shooting at them.

There is also a WiFi minigame. Sometimes the WiFi icon starts to blink red, which means You are getting hacked! By clicking this icon, You can open the minigame to prevent this.
